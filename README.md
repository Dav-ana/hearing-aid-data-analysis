# Projected Hearing Aid Demand in the UK (Adults)

## Project Overview

This project forecasts the potential *future demand for hearing aids* among adults in the United Kingdom by the year **2030**. It uses population data, hearing loss prevalence rates and estimated uptake percentages to forecast the number of individuals likely to use hearing aids.

The aim is to demonstrate how data analysis can be used for decision-making and service planning in healthcare, especially in the context of an ageing popualtion. Additionally showcasing practical data analysis skills including public data interpretation, forecasting, and communication of health-related insights

## 🎯 Key Objectives 

- Estimate how many UK adult may experience hearing loss by 2030.
- Calculate potential hearing aid demand using adoption rates.
- Visualise and communicate the findings clearly.
- Practice data analytics skills with a real-world healthcare example.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Sourcing**  
   - Used ONS projections for 2030 adult population by age group.
   - Applied hearing loss prevalence estimates to each age group.

2. **Uptake Estimation**  
   - Applied estimated hearing aid uptake rates by age group.
   - Calculated expected number of hearing aid users in 2030.

3. **Visualisation**  
   - Created bar and stacked bar charts to show demand patterns.

## 🧠 Key Assumptions 

- Prevalence and uptake rates remain stable over the coming years.
- Age is the primary risk factor for hearing loss.
- Hearing aid uptake reflects current UK trends.
